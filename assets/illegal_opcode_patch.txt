ANE (XAA)

* AND X + AND oper
Highly unstable, do not use.

A base value in A is determined based on the contets of A and a constant, which may be typically $00, $ff, $ee, etc. The value of this constant depends on temerature, the chip series, and maybe other factors, as well.
In order to eliminate these uncertaincies from the equation, use either 0 as the operand or a value of $FF in the accumulator.

ARR

AND oper + ROR

This operation involves the adder:
V-flag is set according to (A AND oper) + oper
The carry is not set, but bit 7 (sign) is exchanged with the carry
